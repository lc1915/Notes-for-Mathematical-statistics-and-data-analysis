# 1. Probability
## frequentist approach & Bayesian approach
One might ask what is meant by the statement “The probability that this coin will land heads up is 1/2.”

Two commonly advocated views are the frequentist approach and the Bayesian approach.

According to the frequentist approach, the statement means that if the experiment were repeated many times, the **long-run average number of heads** would tend to 1/2.

According to the Bayesian approach, the statement is a quantification of the speaker’s uncertainty about the outcome of the experiment and thus is a **personal or subjective notion**; the probability that the coin will land heads up may be different for different speakers, depending on their experience and knowledge of the situation.

There has been vigorous and occasionally acrimonious debate among proponents of various versions of these points of view.

## Independence
### independent
A and B are said to be independent events if **P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B)**.
### mutually independent
We define a collection of events, A1, A2,..., An, to be mutually independent if for any subcollection, Ai1,..., Aim, **P(Ai1 ∩ · · · ∩ Aim) = P(Ai1) · · · P(Aim)**

## BAYES' RULE
P(U1 | U2) = P(U1 ∩ U2)/P(U2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= P(U2 | U1)P(U1) / { P(U2 | U1)P(U1) + P(U2 | M1)P(M1) + P(U2 | L1)P(L1) }
